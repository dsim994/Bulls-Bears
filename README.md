**Bulls and Bears** is a stock quote search app that uses _Yahoo Finance's API_ to request stock data for a searched company. Users can launch the app and are greeted with a simple background view and searchbar. They can then enter the name of their desired company to search. The API will then fetch the data for all companies that match the search and display the results in a tableview to choose from. After the user selects the desired company, the retrieved market data will then display in a different tableview. This app is has a navigation controller so user can then simply back out of any view and make a new company search.
